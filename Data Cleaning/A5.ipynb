This dataset is small enough that we could probably could correct errors by hand, but that approach doesn't scale well. (Would you want to correct a thousand errors by hand? What about ten thousand? Automating things as early as possible is generally a good idea. Plus, it’s fun!)\n\n> **Fuzzy matching:** The process of automatically finding text strings that are very similar to the target string. In general, a string is considered \"closer\" to another one the fewer characters you'd need to change if you were transforming one string into another. So \"apple\" and \"snapple\" are two changes away from each other (add \"s\" and \"n\") while \"in\" and \"on\" and one change away (rplace \"i\" with \"o\"). You won't always be able to rely on fuzzy matching 100%, but it will usually end up saving you at least a little time.\n\nFuzzywuzzy returns a ratio given two strings.
